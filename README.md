# Natours

## Description

This is the official website for Natours, a fictional company that provides adventurous nature tours. The website was built as a practice project to demonstrate Sass skills and responsive web design.

## Disclaimer

This Natours project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Sass**, and **JavaScript** during my bootcamp on Udemy to know more about advance CSS and CSS preprocessor.

Our instructor, **Jonas Schmedtmann**, designed the user interface for this project. He deserves full credit for the UI design. 
The primary objective of this project was to enhance my proficiency in Sass, utilizing the 7-1 Sass Pattern, and to implement responsive web design techniques.
